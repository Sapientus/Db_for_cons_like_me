# Hey, this is my test database. I enjoyed doing this do I wish you to enjoy, too

### How to use this sh*t? ###
1. You may load all package into you PC and then just run "main.py". This will rewrite database and ask requests
2. If you don't wanna rewrite database, you may just run module "select_request.py" and see how it deal with reguests.
